1. Project Description
Our project is to create a fighting game similar to Street Fighters and Shadow Fight(app store).
The basic concept is that there are two players. The players will be able to choose from a selection 
of characters (Cammy, Ryu, Chun-li, and Ken). After choosing characters, the players are sent to the
arena where they will battle it out using different moves and special abilities with the objective 
of KOing their opponent in a set amount of time. Players will have a health bar and a rage bar to activate
special moves. The basic moves for a character include: light punch(A), medium punch(S), heavy punch(D),
light kick(Z), medium kick(X), and heavy kick(C).

2. Directions to compile/run
